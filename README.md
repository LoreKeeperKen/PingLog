# Continuous-Ping-Log
PingLog.bat allows for continuous/timeless pinging with the replies directed to console window and log file. No statistics are displayed or logged, only the ping replies. 

An IP or URL can be passed to the batch file in cmd, entered at the IP/URL prompt, or no IP/URL can be entered when prompted and the default IP 8.8.8.8 will be used. 

The log file is date and timestamped. And each ping reply is timestamped.
