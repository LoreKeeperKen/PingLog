# PingLog

PingLog allows for continuous/timeless pinging with the replies directed to console window and log file. No statistics are displayed or logged, only the ping replies.

### Usage

PingLog was built for troubleshooting intermintent network/internet problems related to:
 * latency
 * connection loss
 
## Behaviour 

The IP/URL can be passed as the first argument, entered at the IP/URL prompt, or no IP/URL can <br>
be entered when prompted and the default IP 8.8.8.8 will be used. 

The log file is date and timestamped. And each ping reply is timestamped.
