# PingLog

PingLog allows for continuous/timeless pinging with the replies directed to console window and log file. 

### Usage

PingLog was built for troubleshooting intermintent network/internet problems related to:
 * latency
 * connection loss
 
## Behaviour 

### Execute From Command Prompt

The IP/URL can be passed as an argument when PingLog is called in the command prompt. Any standard ping options will be ignored by PingLog. 


### Execute by Double Click Batch File

When executed, PingLog will prompt the user for an IP/URL. If no IP/URL is entered PingLog will use the default IP.

No statistics are displayed or logged, only the ping replies.
